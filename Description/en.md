# This is a script to improve the display of Twitter

We plan to add more in the future

## Changes:

| Effect                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Change TL time from relative to absolute time**                            | **As the name suggests. Relative time is annoying. (e.g., 06:15:03 06/17/24, Mon)**                                                                                                  |
| **Display time and date in sidebar**                                         | **You could just look at the bottom right of the taskbar, but not having the time on the page makes me fidgety. Also, I've customized my taskbar and the date is a bit hard to see** |
| **Reclaim Twitter (restore icon)**                                           | **Reclaim our Twitter! Change the X icon in the top left of the page and splash screen back to the bird. Restore the home and premium icons in the header.**                         |
| **Revert video player to default**                                           | **Because Twitter's video player is hard to use.**                                                                                                                                   |
| Remove basic borders                                                         | It looks cooler without borders.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Remove scrollbar from header                                                 | Just in case for elements that might be added in the future. Also, it looked unsightly when displayed at low heights.                                                                |
| Remove "Subscribe to Premium" from sidebar                                   | Because I won't.                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Remove "Who to follow" from sidebar                                          | I've never registered from here.                                                                                                                                                     |
| Change TL width from 600px to 700px, right sidebar width from 350px to 250px | The sidebar doesn't need this much width. Even this is too big.                                                                                                                      |
