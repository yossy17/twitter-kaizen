# This is a script to improve the display of Twitter

We plan to add more in the future

## Feature

### Change TL time from relative to absolute time

As the name suggests. Relative time is annoying.
e.g.: `06:15:03 06/17/24, Mon`

### Display time and date in sidebar

look in the lower right hand corner of the taskbar, but I get fidgety when I don't see the time on the page. Also, I have customized the taskbar so the date is a little hard to see.

### Reclaim Twitter (restore icon)

Reclaim our Twitter! Change the X icon in the top left of the page and splash screen back to the bird. Restore the home and premium icons in the header.

### Revert video player to default

Twitter's video player is hard to use.

### Easy access to quoted tweets

Added link to quoted tweets in the status section of article pages.

**Remove basic borders**  
It looks cooler without borders.

**Remove scrollbar from header**  
Just in case for elements that might be added in the future. Also, it looked unsightly when displayed at low heights.

**Remove "Subscribe to Premium" from sidebar**  
I won't.

**Remove "Who to follow" from sidebar**  
I've never registered from here.

**Change TL width from 600px to 700px, right sidebar width from 350px to 250px, and reply sidebar width during image enlargement from 350px to 550px**  
The sidebar doesn't need this much width. Even this is too big.

Fixed other minor CSS elements
